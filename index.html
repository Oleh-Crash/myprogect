<h3>Dubai</h3>
<p>Dubai is mostly used as a stopover destination for travelers flying in and out on Emirates.
 While Dubai can easily be a stopover city where you hit the big sites in a couple of days, there’s 
 a surprising amount of things to do here for those looking to spend more time.
  I loved my time in Dubai more than I thought I would! It’s a city 
  trapped between the old and the new. A place in a conservative culture with old world customs while at the same time 
  a Middle-Eastern Vegas where anything goes (so long as it’s behind closed doors). 
I was surprised at how much there was to do in this city – and how even in a week I barely scratched the surface
</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>London is a common stop on most backpacking trips, European vacations, or two-week holidays.
 Everyone wants to come to London! People are drawn to it by images of pubs, museums, history, 
 attractions, theater, and diverse culture. I mean it’s London. It’s a big name. How can you not go, right?
I love visiting London. I’ve been visiting since 2008 and, with every subsequent visit,
the city has grown on me. The more I go, the more wonder I see. There’s always something new to do here.</p>

<h3>Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin is Germany’s capital and the largest city in the country.
     Berlin has become very popular with students and young artists, writers, and creatives who have become the city’s new immigrants.
     While I dislike the “industrial” look of the city, the art, history, and nightlife cannot be beat. 
     Berlin is an old city with a young heart and one of the most fun, coolest, diverse. and eclectic cities in Europe.
     There’s a constant sense of motion here.
     I didn’t like my first visit to Berlin but the city has really grown on me. 
     This is a city where “things are happening” and it’s probably the most vibrant city on the continent.</p>
<h3>Warszawa</h3>
<p>Warsaw is a bustling, revitalized city that is casting off the long shadow of Communism. 
   I loved visiting this city. Stroll down the boulevards, explore the wealth of Chopin music, admire traditional art pieces, and soak up this modern city. 
   All around you see these grim Communist buildings giving way to a city filled with optimism, history, public gardens, and modernity.
   I thought the city had more charm, fewer tourists, and a much more visible cross-section of Polish history.</p>
