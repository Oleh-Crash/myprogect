    <header><h1>Welkome to Londone tour</h1>
       
        
        <p>London is a common stop on most backpacking trips, European vacations, or two-week holidays.
        Everyone wants to come to London! People are drawn to it by images of pubs, museums, history, attractions, theater, and diverse culture.
        I mean it’s London. It’s a big name. How can you not go, right?</p>
        <p>I love visiting London. I’ve been visiting since 2008 and, with every subsequent visit, the city has grown on me. The more I go, the more wonder I see. There’s always something new to do here.
        The only problem with London is that it’s very, very expensive; it can eat away at your budget if you aren’t careful.
        Luckily, there are tons of free or cheap things to do in London that can fill your time.</p>

    <h2>Other Things to See and Do in London <a id="thingstoseeanddo"></a></h2>
    <p>1. Go museum hopping
        London has more museums than you could see in one visit, and many of them are free.
        From the Tate to the City Museum to the National Gallery to the Historical Museum,
        you’ll be able to spend days here without spending a penny! At the Natural History Museum,
        you’ll find over 80 million items, including specimens collected by Charles Darwin. 
        It also has a great collection of fossils, making it a fun and educational stop if
            you’re traveling with kids. The Victoria and Albert Museum (named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert) is another favorite of mine. 
        It’s home to over 2,000 works of art covering over 3,000 years of human history.</p>
    <p>2. Grab some food in Borough Market
            With more food stalls than you can imagine, Borough Market has something for every eater. 
            It is home to some of the best British and international produce and dishes. Come here hungry and leave satisfied.
            Already ate? Nibble the free samples being given out at most stalls. Open for lunch Mondays and Tuesdays, all day Wednesday-Saturdays and closed on Sundays. 
            The crowds are terrible on Saturdays, but if that’s the only day you can fit it in, I’d go anyway! </p>
    <p>3. Take in the theater
London is known for its’ famous theater scene. Attend a show while you’re here and see some of the shows that make London famous. 
Tickets can be pretty cheap, and something is playing every night (check out TKTS for discounted tickets for shows in the West End). 
Otherwise, catch a Shakespeare show at The Globe in South London — tickets start from £7 ($10 USD).</p>
<p>4. Stroll along Brick Lane
On Sunday, this little street, and the car park becomes a great place for cheap food. 
You can get a wide variety of food here, spend the day at the outdoor market, or have some great local curry. It’s a popular place with the locals and has some of the best food in London. This street is also a great place to bring a camera, 
as its’ walls are basically a gallery for London’s best graffiti artists.</p>
<p>5. Ride the London Eye
The London Eye is basically a 500-feet tall ferris wheel, and it has become the most popular paid-for UK visitor attraction.
 It’s across the street from Parliament and gives you great views of London, especially on a clear day. 
But honestly, for £27 ($35 USD), you are better off spending that money on other attractions.</p>

    <h2><a id="bestplacestobookyourtrip">London Travel Guide: The Best Booking Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
        <li> Momondo – This is my favorite booking site. I never book a flight without checking here first.</li>
            <li>Skyscanner – Skyscanner is another great flight search engine which searches
             a lot of different airlines, including many of the budget carriers that larger sites miss.
              While I always start with Momondo, I use this site too as a way to compare prices.</li> 
              <li>Airbnb – Airbnb is a great accommodation alternative for connecting with homeowners 
              who rent out their homes or apartments. (If you’re new to Airbnb, get $35 off your first stay!)</li>
            <li>Hostelworld – This is the best hostel accommodation site out there, with the largest inventory, 
            best search interface, and widest availability.</li>
             <li>Couchsurfing – This website allows you to stay on people’s couches or spare rooms for free. 
             It’s a great way to save money while meeting locals who can tell you the ins and outs of their city. 
             The site also lists events you can attend to meet people (even if you’re not staying with someone).</li>   
              <li>Booking.com – The best all-around booking site that constantly provides the cheapest and lowest rates.
               They have a no money down policy, great interface, and the widest selection of budget accommodation. 
               In all my tests, they’ve always had the cheapest rates out of all bookers.</li>  
               <li>Intrepid Travel – If you want to do a group tour around Sweden, go with Intrepid Travel.
                 They offer small group tours that use local operators and leave a small environmental footprint.
                  If you go on a tour with anyone, go with them. And, as a reader of this site, you’ll get exclusive discounts 
                  when you click the link!</li>
                  <li>Rome 2 Rio – This website allows you to see how to get from point A to point B the best and cheapest way possible.
                 It will give you all the bus, train, plane, or boat routes that can get you there as well as how much they cost.</li>
                <li>EatWith – This website allows you to eat home cooked meal with locals.
                 Locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that you can sign up for.
                  There is a fee (everyone sets their own price) but this is a great way to do something different,
                   pick a local’s brain, and make a new friend.</li> 
                   <li>Fat Tire Tours – If you want to see alot of sights in a short amount of time, take a bike tour with Fat Tire Tours. 
                   They use expert local guides and their tours are always fun and informative 
                   (they have a great pub tour in London as well!).</li>
                   <li>Bla Bla Car – BlaBlaCar is a ridesharing website that lets you share rides
                    with vetted local drivers by pitching in for gas. You simply request a seat, they approve, and off you go! 
                   It’s a cheaper and more interesting way travel than by bus or train!</li>
