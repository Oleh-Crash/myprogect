   <header> <h1>Welkome to Berlin tour</h1>
   

    <p>Berlin is Germany’s capital and the largest city in the country.\
     Berlin has become very popular with students and young artists, writers, and creatives who have become the city’s new immigrants.
     While I dislike the “industrial” look of the city, the art, history, and nightlife cannot be beat. 
     Berlin is an old city with a young heart and one of the most fun, coolest, diverse. and eclectic cities in Europe.
     There’s a constant sense of motion here.
     I didn’t like my first visit to Berlin but the city has really grown on me. 
     This is a city where “things are happening” and it’s probably the most vibrant city on the continent.
     This travel guide to Berlin will help point the way by giving you tips on what to see, costs, suggested budgets, 
     ways to save money, and everything else you need to plan a great trip!</p>

       <h2>Other Things to See and Do in Berlin <a name="thingstoseeanddo"></a></h2>
       <p>1. Hang out in Potsdamer Platz
In the 1920s, Potsdamer Platz was the busiest square in Europe, but it was destroyed in World War II and divided by the Berlin Wall. 
After German reunification, it became the largest building site in Europe as it was transformed into a showpiece for the “new Berlin,” with modern architecture like skyrises, hotels, cinemas, shopping centers, and the massive central plaza, the Sony Center. Frankly, it’s not the most interesting part of Berlin — but if you want to experience a bit of the city’s business district after all the grittiness elsewhere,
 this is a good place to do it.</p>
 <p>2. See the famous Reichstag
The seat of the German Parliament is one of Berlin’s most historic landmarks.
 It now has a new clear dome (to promote “transparency” in the government) and draws some of the biggest crowds in Berlin.
  You can visit the dome (it’s free!), but you have to make a reservation ahead of time. From up there, 
  you’ll get panoramic views over the city, and the dome has an interior exhibition on the parliament’s history.
 (Bring your passport!)</p>
 <p>3. Visit Alexanderplatz and Fernsehturm TV tower
Germany’s most famous city square contains the 368-meter high Fernsehturm TV tower. 
You can visit the tower’s observation deck for dazzling views of the city. 
Tickets start from €16.50 EUR ($18 USD). Otherwise, Alexanderplatz is an exciting hub of activity as people come to shop, eat, and hang out.</p>
<p>4. Spend time at the Deutsches Historisches Museum
The German Historical Museum covers everything from prehistory right up to the present day. 
There are so many in-depth exhibits here you’ll want to schedule a few uninterrupted hours to see it all. It’s one of my favorite history museums in the world! Highlights include a 3.5-meter tall coat of arms column from 1486, Napoleon’s hat from the battle of Waterloo in 1815, 
and a personal computer from the GDR times. Admission is €8 EUR ($8.80 USD).</p>
<p>5. Relax in Tempelhof Park
Located in the southern part of the city, this park is actually the site of the old airport that was used during the Berlin Airlift 
(when the Soviets tried to blockade the city). You’ll find a lot of plaques and information about the old airport now. 
You’ll see lots of people running and working out here, and in the summer months, people take over the barbecue pits.</p>

<h2><a name="typicalcosts">Berlin Travel Costs</a></h2>
<p>Hostel prices – Four to eight bed dorms cost between €32-36 EUR ($35-40 USD) per night while dorms with ten 
beds or more costs about €27 EUR ($30 USD) per night.

although those rooms are rare.

You’ll find currywurst, kebabs, and quick pizzas all for under €5.50 EUR ($5 USD). For the best kebabs, go to Mustafas. 
You’ll get a filling, incredibly delicious meal for €10 EUR ($11 USD).
For another cheap eat, check out Thai Park (Preußen Park). During the summer, Thai locals will come to the park and cook up some 
delicious and affordable Thai food. It started as just a small Thai community gathering, but it’s now a huge food market where 
you can get awesome eats for under €10 EUR ($11 USD).
A meal at McDonald’s will cost about €7 EUR ($8 USD). A meal of chicken red curry lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant is 
about €4.50 EUR ($5 USD). A beer will cost about €3.50 EUR ($4 USD) at any bar or beer garden.

<h2><a name="suggestedbudget">Backpacking Berlin Suggested Budgets</a></h2>

<p>If you’re backpacking Berlin, expect to spend about €57 EUR ($63 USD) per day. This is assuming you’re staying in a hostel, 
eating lots of cheap and fast food, 
cooking some meals, using public transportation to get around, and visiting about one attraction per day (like a museum).</p>

enjoy some drinks, take some taxis, and do all the tours you want!</p>

<h2><a name="bestplacestobookyourtrip">Berlin Travel Guide: The Best Booking Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
        <li> Momondo – This is my favorite booking site. I never book a flight without checking here first.</li>
            <li>Skyscanner – Skyscanner is another great flight search engine which searches
             a lot of different airlines, including many of the budget carriers that larger sites miss.
              While I always start with Momondo, I use this site too as a way to compare prices.</li> 
              <li>Airbnb – Airbnb is a great accommodation alternative for connecting with homeowners 
              who rent out their homes or apartments. (If you’re new to Airbnb, get $35 off your first stay!)</li>
            <li>Hostelworld – This is the best hostel accommodation site out there, with the largest inventory, 
            best search interface, and widest availability.</li>
             <li>Couchsurfing – This website allows you to stay on people’s couches or spare rooms for free. 
             It’s a great way to save money while meeting locals who can tell you the ins and outs of their city. 
             The site also lists events you can attend to meet people (even if you’re not staying with someone).</li>   
              <li>Booking.com – The best all-around booking site that constantly provides the cheapest and lowest rates.
               They have a no money down policy, great interface, and the widest selection of budget accommodation. 
               In all my tests, they’ve always had the cheapest rates out of all bookers.</li>  
               <li>Intrepid Travel – If you want to do a group tour around Sweden, go with Intrepid Travel.
                 They offer small group tours that use local operators and leave a small environmental footprint.
                  If you go on a tour with anyone, go with them. And, as a reader of this site, you’ll get exclusive discounts 
                  when you click the link!</li>
                  <li>Rome 2 Rio – This website allows you to see how to get from point A to point B the best and cheapest way possible.
                 It will give you all the bus, train, plane, or boat routes that can get you there as well as how much they cost.</li>
                <li>EatWith – This website allows you to eat home cooked meal with locals.
                 Locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that you can sign up for.
                  There is a fee (everyone sets their own price) but this is a great way to do something different,
                   pick a local’s brain, and make a new friend.</li>

       <h2><a name="berlingearandpackingguide">Berlin Gear and Packing Guide</a> </h2>
       <p>If you’re heading to Berlin, here are my suggestions for the best travel backpack and tips on what to pack for your trip.</p>
      <p><h2>The Best Backpack for Berlin</h2></p> 
      <p>What’s the best backpack for traveling around Berlin? I recommend the REI Flash 45 Pack. It’s light and comfy, front loading, and fits perfectly in an airplane’s overhead bin.
            Size: 45-47L
            Straps: Thick and cushy with compression technology that pulls the pack’s load up and inwards so it doesn’t feel as heavy.
            Features: Removable top lid, large pocket at the front, hydration compatible, contoured hip belt</p>
       <h2>Clothes</h2> 

                  <li> 1 pair of jeans (heavy and not easily dried, but I like them; a good alternative is khaki pants)</li> 
                   <li> 1 pair of shorts</li>
                   <li> 1 bathing suit</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Toiletries</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1 dry shampoo spray & talc powder (keeps long hair grease-free in between washes)</li>
