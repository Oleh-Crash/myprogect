   <h1>Welkome to Warszawa Tour</h1>
   <p>Warsaw is a bustling, revitalized city that is casting off the long shadow of Communism. 
   I loved visiting this city. Stroll down the boulevards, explore the wealth of Chopin music, admire traditional art pieces, and soak up this modern city. 
   All around you see these grim Communist buildings giving way to a city filled with optimism, history, public gardens, and modernity.
   I thought the city had more charm, fewer tourists, and a much more visible cross-section of Polish history.
   This travel guide to the city of Warsaw can help you plan your epic trip there by giving you all the tips and tricks you need to know!

            <h2><a name="#thingstoseeanddo" id= "things">Things to see and dothings to see and do</a></h2>
               <p> 1. Wander the Old TownThe streets of the Old Town offer a nice contrast to the modern, bustling city that surrounds them. 
                The area suffered heavy damage during World War Two so many of the medieval buildings have been reconstructed, 
                but it’s nevertheless a great place to start your trip.</p>
               <p>2. Explore the Chopin MuseumFrederic Chopin is one of the most famous composers in history and his works can 
                still be heard in concert halls across the globe. Chopin grew up in Warsaw before the Uprising of 1830.
                 This museum provides an overview of his life and work. Admission is 22 PLN, though it’s free on Wednesdays.</p> 

                <p>3. The Royal CastleLocated at the entrance to the Old Town, the Royal Castle was the former residence of the Polish monarchs.
                 It was partially destroyed (and looted) by the Nazis in 1939 and then was almost completely destroyed in 1944.
                  It has since undergone extensive restoration and is now a museum.</p> 

               <p>4. Learn about the Warsaw UprisingOpened in 2004, the museum is home to hundreds of artifacts from the uprising of 1944, 
                when Polish citizens rebelled against German occupation. 
                The uprising lasted 63 days and was the largest resistance during World War II. The museum has tons of clothing, letters, and interactive films.
               </p> 
                
               <p> 5. Visit the Powazki Cemetery
                Established in 1790, this cemetery is the final resting place of many important 
                figures in Polish history, including the family of Frederic Chopin (he is buried in Paris, though his literal
                 heart was brought back to Poland when he died in 1849), some of Chopin’s early teachers, 
                 Krzysztof Komeda (a famous jazz composer), and Nobel Prize winner W?adys?aw Reymont. 
                 It’s the city’s oldest cemetery and the sculptures and architecture surrounding the tombs are both serene and eerie. 
                It makes for a quiet place for a walk.</p>
               <p>6. Tour the Gestapo Headquarters Museum
                Officially known as the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom, its focus is on the conflict between 
                the Polish resistance and the Gestapo, with a profound exhibit taking you through the old detention cells which 
                were used to hold and torture prisoners. Prisoners were subjected to beatings, attacked with dogs, and even electrocuted. 
                And if they didn’t co-operate, their family would be brought in and tortured before their very eyes. It’s a sobering place. 
                Admission is 10 PLN (free on Thursdays).</p> 
               <p> 6. Visit the Museum of Modern Art
                Established in 2005 and located only a few minutes’ walk from the Central Railway Station, 
                this small museum features contemporary art by Polish and international artists. I’m not much of a modern art fan, 
                but there are some cool exhibitions here as well as some thought-provoking art. Admission is 5 PLN and they are regular guided tours in English of the exhibitions. 
                Check the website for more details, including what temporary exhibits are available.</p>
               <p>7. The Copernicus Science Center
                The Copernicus Science Center is one of the most modern science centers in Europe. 
                Located on the bank of the Vistula River, it has over 450 interactive exhibits, allowing visitors to take part in all 
                sorts of experiments involving light, sounds, and electricity. There’s a planetarium here as well. Admission is 31 PLN.</p> 

              <p>8. Visit the POLIN
                The Museum of the History of Polish Jews is a new museum with both permanent and temporary 
                exhibitions as well as performances and workshops about Jewish history and culture. 
                The museum documents the history of the Jews in Poland from the Middles Ages to the present.
                 Over 90% of the Jewish population in Poland was killed by the Nazis in WWII,
                  and the museum was built on the spot where the Warsaw Ghetto was located 
                  (be sure to take a walking tour of the area to learn more about the Warsaw Ghetto and the fate of Jews in Poland during the WWII).
                   Admission is 27 PLN.</p>  

              <p>9. Take a free walking tour
                One of the best things you can do when you arrive in a new city is to take a walking tour. 
                It’s a great way to get the lay of the land and learn about the culture, people, and history of the destination.
                 Walkative and Orange Umbrella both offer free tours in English with a variety of different focuses 
                 (such as the Old Town, street art, WWII, and the Communist Era). These tours provide much more insight than any guidebook.
                  Just be sure to tip your guides at the end.</p>  

               <p> 10. Visit the Palace of Culture and Science
                This building dominates the city skyline and looms ever-present in the city. It’s the tallest building in the country,
                 home to 42 floors, theatres, a multi-screen cinema, museums, and much more. The building was a “gift” to 
                 Poland from the Soviet Union in 1955. It offers a great view of the city from the 30th floor
                  (there is an observation deck there which is free to access with the Warsaw Pass).</p>

            </p>
            <p>    Campgrounds can be found just 5-10km outside the city center

                Stews and soups (like borscht, a beet soup) are popular and can be found at most local restaurants.
                For something more specific to Poland, try beef tongue or pork knuckles.

                vegetables, chicken, and other basic staples.

<article>           
    <h2><a name="suggestedbudget">Suggested Budget</a></h2>
                <p>On a backpacker budget, you can visit Warsaw for 115-190 PLN ($30-40 USD) per day. This is a suggested budget assuming you’re staying in a cheap hostel or camping, cooking most of your meals, and using local transportation. On this budget, you’ll have to stick to mostly free activities (like free walking tours) while occasionally paying to visit a museum or attraction.
                To lower your expenses, try Couchsurfing, limiting your drinking, and cutting out all restaurants.</p>
                <p>On a mid-range budget of about 230-290 PLN ($60-75 USD), you’ll be able to stay in a budget hotel, take a few taxis,
                 eat out at more often, take paid tours, and visit more attractions per day. You’ll be able to enjoy your time here 
                 without worry too much about your spending.</p>
               <p> On a luxury budget of 540+ PLN ($140+ USD), you can stay in a nice hotel, eat out for every meal, take taxis, drink as often as you’d like,
                and visit as many museums and attractions as you want. 
               You can live large on this budget and, after that, the sky is the limit!
                You can use the chart below to get some idea of how much you need to budget daily, 
                depending on your travel style. Keep in mind these are daily averages — some days you’ll spend more, some days you’ll 
                spend less (you might spend less every day). We just want to give you a general idea of how to make your budget. Prices are in USD.

       <p>These are my favorite companies to use when I travel to Warsaw.

        <ul>
        <li> Momondo – This is my favorite booking site. I never book a flight without checking here first.</li>
            <li>Skyscanner – Skyscanner is another great flight search engine which searches
             a lot of different airlines, including many of the budget carriers that larger sites miss.
              While I always start with Momondo, I use this site too as a way to compare prices.</li> 
              <li>Airbnb – Airbnb is a great accommodation alternative for connecting with homeowners 
              who rent out their homes or apartments. (If you’re new to Airbnb, get $35 off your first stay!)</li>

                <li> World Nomads – I buy all my travel insurance from World Nomads.

                 Locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that you can sign up for.
                  There is a fee (everyone sets their own price) but this is a great way to do something different,
                   pick a local’s brain, and make a new friend.</li>

                <p><h2>The Best Backpack for Warsaw</h2></p>
                <p>What’s the best backpack for traveling around Warsaw? I recommend the REI Flash 45 Pack.

                Size: 45-47L
                Straps: Thick and cushy with compression technology that pulls the pack’s load up and inwards so it doesn’t feel as heavy.

                <h2>What to Pack for Warsaw</h2>

                    <li>Feminine hygiene products (you can opt to buy there too, but I prefer not to count on it, and most people have their preferred products)</li>
